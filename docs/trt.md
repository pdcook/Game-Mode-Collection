## Introduction

Trouble In ROUNDS Town (TRT) is a role-playing game mode where some players are "traitors" and some are "innocent." The traitors' goal is to eliminate all of the non-traitors. The innocents' goal is to figure out who the traitors are, and then kill them.

***This game is very different from normal ROUNDS: random killing is against both the spirit of the game and the rules. There are in-game systems to punish random killing, discussed later in this document.***

This game mode is a near-exact one-to-one port of [TTT from Gary's Mod](https://www.troubleinterroristtown.com/). So if you've played TTT, lots of this will be familiar.

## Quick Reference

This section is a quick reference for if you already know how to play and just need the quick facts. The rest of this document provides a detailed guide on how to play.

- Every round has a thirty second preparation phase during which players can collect cards from around the map (default control: "F" or left stick button).
- Every round players' roles are randomly determined
- **_Dead players cannot communicate with alive players by any means. This includes external voice chat._**
- Detectives, Traitors, Mercenaries, Killers, and Zombies all have access to a shop.
- Players can have a maximum of 2 cards. Custom cards bought in a shop do not count.
- Players can discard their most recent card (default control: "Q" or Y/Î”) or any card by clicking on it in the card bar.
- Killing teammates causes you to lose karma. This will negatively effect the amount of damage you do in future rounds.
- Players gain karma each round they complete without team-killing.
- If a player's karma drops too low, they will be automatically killed at the end of the next preparation phase.
- Players can inspect bodies (default control: "E" or right stick down).
- Players can zoom in and out (default control: scrool wheel or right bumper + D-pad up/down). The maximum zoom a player can use is determined by their gun's projectile speed stat.


## Gameplay

TRT takes place with a group of players, some of whom are traitors. The traitors know who is a traitor and who isn't, **but innocent players do *not* know who is a traitor or who is innocent.**

At the start of each round, some players are randomly selected to be traitors. There will always be at least one traitor. Traitors are notified that they have been selected, and the clock/role display in the upper left will display this as well.

Additionally, a small number of innocent players will be selected to be a **detective**. Detectives are _always_ innocent and everyone can see who the detectives are. Detectives have special abilities and access to a shop to help the innocents against the traitors.

**Innocent players will always make up the majority.** To overcome their numbers disadvantage, the traitors must leverage the fact that their identities are initially secret. Additionally, traitors have access to a shop in which they can buy useful weapons and equipment.


### Winning

Traitors win when all of the innocent players are dead.

Innocents win when all of the traitors are dead _or_ the time limit is reached and at least one innocent is still alive.

### Death

When a player dies, they can no longer talk to players who are still alive. They have a separate in-game chat reserved for dead players.

***If you are playing with a group in an external voice call, everyone must follow the rule that if you are dead, you cannot speak.***

When a player dies, no one is notified, no score is updated, nothing changes. Their body will stay on the map and can be found by other players. If another player finds their body, they can (and should!) identify it by walking up to it and inspecting it (default control: "E" or right stick button). This will announce to the entire server which player identified the body, whose body it was, and what role they were. If a detective inspects a body, it will reveal additional information for everyone such as how long ago the player died and the color of the last player that either they shot or shot them.

Dead players begin spectating the game but are still unable to see living players' roles, since there are circumstances where dead players can be revived.

### Rounds

Each round has two phases: **preparing** and **active** (or in-progress).
