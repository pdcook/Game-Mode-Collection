## Introduction

Crown Control is a game mode that can be played either in free-for-all or team-deathmatch mode. It is a hybrid between traditional capture the flag and king of the hill style game modes. The objective is to hold the crown for a set amount of time to win each point.

Players can (and should) attack and kill one-another to prevent their opponents from holding the crown.

## Gameplay

To win a point, the player (or team) must hold the crown for a _total_ of 20 seconds (by default.) Players capture a loose crown simply by walking up to it. Players drop the crown only when they die.

At the start of each point, the crown will spawn at the top center of the screen. If at any point the crown falls off the map, it will respawn at the farthest player spawn point from all other players. If the crown goes untouched for more than 20 seconds, it will also respawn in this same manner. If the crown respawns too many times in a single point, the point will end in a draw and no players will be awarded points.

Players spawn as usual at the start of each point and become active after a short countdown. When a player is killed, they will respawn after a short delay in a spawn point far from the crown and all enemy players. Each time the player dies, the delay before their next respawn will increase. This delay is reset between points.

Players pick cards according to the usual ROUNDS rules.
