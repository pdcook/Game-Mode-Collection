## Introduction

Dodgeball is a niche game mode in which players compete (either as individuals or as teams) to either be the first one to destroy the "dodgeball" or otherwise be the last alive.

The "dodgeball" is a dangerous, erratic object with much more health than any player which spawns at the start of each point. The dodgeball takes damage just as a player would, but deals massive stun damage when it contacts a player at high speeds.

In this gamemode, players cannot directly deal damage to each other. The only way for players to damage one another is by trying to direct the dodgeball toward their opponent.

## Gameplay

To win a point, the player (or team) must either:

- Deal the final blow to the dodgeball, or
- Be the last alive

At the start of the point, a dodgeball will spawn at the top middle of the map. There are four different dodgeballs:

- Ball
- Square
- Triangle
- Rod

Each dodgeball obeys the same rules and physics, but their different shapes can lead to very different behaviors.

As the game progresses, multiple dodgeballs may spawn during the course of a single point. When this is the case, **_only the first dodgeball spawned_** will award a team victory when destroyed.

Card picks follow normal ROUNDS rules.
