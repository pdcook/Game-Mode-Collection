## What is Hide & Seek?

Hide & seek is a gamemode where a group of seekers need to ~~find~~ kill all the hiders.

## IMPORTANT NOTE: if this gamemode is played with cards that don't properly remove themself on player reset (aka they persist through a rematch) this gamemode <font size ="6">will break</font>

## How does it work?

At the start of every point â…“ of the players are randomly selected to be seekers the rest become hiders.

### The seekers

- The seekers are bright red and have (amount of hiders * 15) seconds to kill all the hiders.
- They get 3 points * (percentage of hiders killed) if they win the round.
- If they die by accident (aka they die to the border) all hiders get 1 point.

### The hiders

- The hiders need to hide from the seekers or kill all seekers.
- They get 1 point for every seeker they kill if they win the round.
- Hiders get a hidden effect that makes them a bit weaker than normal.
- If there is one hider left and the time left is less than half they get a trail effect that makes them easier to see.
